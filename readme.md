# Employee Report 👩‍🦰👨‍🦱👨‍🦳

## Introduction

This repo was produced from [this kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/Employee-Report/). It describes the project requirements.

In summary the aim is to filter and modify a list of employees in accordance with the specification. I was advised to create a single function with all of the required functionality. The function was modified incrementally using TDD (test driven development) to fulfil one user story at a time.

TDD red, green, refactor methodology should be used.

I used this project as an opportunity to practice the AAA testing pattern:
- Arrange: Set up the test. Create objects, mock setups, define expectations as required.
- Act: Invoke the method to be tested.
- Assert: Check whether the expectations were met.

You can read about the AAA pattern [here](https://medium.com/@pjbgf/title-testing-code-ocd-and-the-aaa-pattern-df453975ab80).
